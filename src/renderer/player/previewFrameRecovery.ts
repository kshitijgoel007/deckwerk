/**
 * Bring frameless preview videos back after the page stops being hidden.
 *
 * A `<video>` paints nothing until a frame is decoded, and Chromium is free to
 * reclaim a hidden or occluded page's media buffers — which is exactly what a
 * presentation does to the editor behind it. Come back from Present and some
 * previews are black, with no request in flight to fix them: the poster-frame
 * seek in `renderVideo` was a `once` listener that already fired, so nothing
 * re-decodes the frame until some unrelated event happens to touch the
 * element. The symptom is thumbnails that are black for a while, then fill in
 * one at a time for no visible reason.
 *
 * This module closes that hole: when the page becomes visible again, every
 * preview video without a paintable frame is re-queued through the load gate
 * with its poster seek re-armed. Recovery therefore obeys the same
 * three-at-a-time connection budget as a fresh mount (docs/media-loading.md),
 * and videos the gate is already carrying are left alone.
