 * land the target object exactly on top of the source object's *rendered*
 * appearance, the object flies in from the side instead of moving. So it is
 * pure, and tested against measured layouts rather than against itself.
 *
 * Two rules keep it honest:
 *
 * 1. `transform-origin` is always the element centre — the same origin the
 *    settled render uses. Anchoring the scale somewhere else (a text box's
 *    alignment corner, say) means the final keyframe no longer describes the
 *    settled position, so the object snaps when the fill-none animation ends,
 *    and any rotation swings about the wrong point.
 * 2. The anchor a pair is aligned on is therefore folded into the translate,
 *    not expressed as an origin. `foldAnchor` below is exact for any source
 *    rotation or authored transform.
