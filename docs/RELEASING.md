# Releasing DeckWerk

Cutting a release is `npm version` plus a tag push. Everything else —
building, signing, notarizing, and updating the Homebrew and Flathub
channels — is [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml).

```bash
npm version minor          # updates package.json and creates the v<x.y.z> tag
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

The workflow refuses to run if the tag and `package.json` disagree, so the
`npm version` step is not optional.

To rehearse without publishing anything, run the workflow manually from the
Actions tab with **dry run** left checked: it builds and signs on all four
runners and uploads the installers as workflow artifacts, but creates no
release and touches no channel.

## Why four runners for three operating systems

Nothing here can be cross-built:

- `ffmpeg-static` and `ffprobe-static` fetch a binary for the *install* host
  during `npm ci`, and `src/main/ffmpeg.ts` ships whatever it finds.
- The Keynote and PowerPoint importers are PyInstaller freezes, and
  PyInstaller cannot cross-compile — not even between macOS architectures.
  Hence a `macos-14` (arm64) job and a `macos-13` (Intel) job rather than one
  universal build.
- Notarization only runs on macOS; Azure Trusted Signing only runs on Windows,
  because electron-builder drives it through a PowerShell module.

Linux builds on `ubuntu-22.04` deliberately. A binary linked against a newer
glibc will not start on an older distribution, while the reverse is fine, so
the oldest supported base wins.

## One-time setup

### 1. Apple Developer ID (macOS)

Without this, macOS refuses to open the app at all — including when it was
installed through Homebrew, which applies the same quarantine attribute a
browser download would. Signing without notarization is not a partial win;
Gatekeeper treats it exactly like unsigned.

Export the *Developer ID Application* certificate as a `.p12`, then:

```bash
base64 -i DeveloperID.p12 | pbcopy    # -> CSC_LINK
```

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CSC_LINK` | base64 of the `.p12` |
| `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` | password used when exporting the `.p12` |
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple ID email |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | app-specific password from appleid.apple.com |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | 10-character team ID |

`electron-builder.config.cjs` turns signing *and* notarization off together
when these are absent, so pull requests and forks still produce a build.

### 2. Azure Trusted Signing (Windows)

Create a Trusted Signing account and certificate profile, then an Entra ID
app registration with the **Trusted Signing Certificate Profile Signer** role
on that account.

| Repository secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | directory (tenant) ID |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | application (client) ID |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` | client secret |

| Repository variable | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `AZURE_CODE_SIGNING_ENDPOINT` | `https://eus.codesigning.azure.net` |
| `AZURE_CODE_SIGNING_ACCOUNT` | Trusted Signing account name |
| `AZURE_CODE_SIGNING_PROFILE` | certificate profile name |

The identifiers are not secret and live in variables so they are visible in
logs when a signing run goes wrong.

### 3. Homebrew tap (macOS)

Create a public repository `vsitzmann/homebrew-tap`, then add a fine-grained
PAT with **contents: read and write** on it as the secret
`TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` — the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is scoped to this repository
and cannot push to the tap.

```bash
brew install --cask vsitzmann/tap/deckwerk
```

Moving into homebrew-cask proper needs the project to clear their notability
bar; the tap has no such requirement and works from the first release.

### 4. Flathub (Linux)

A one-time manual submission, because Flathub builds from its own repository
rather than from this one.

1. Add real screenshots at `docs/assets/screenshots/editor.png` and
   `presenter.png` on the default branch. Flathub rejects submissions whose
   screenshot URLs 404, and at least one screenshot is required.
2. Prove control of `deckwerk.org`, since the app ID is `org.deckwerk.DeckWerk`.
   A live site at that domain is sufficient.
3. Open a pull request against `flathub/flathub` adding
   [`flatpak/org.deckwerk.DeckWerk.yml`](../flatpak/org.deckwerk.DeckWerk.yml).

Verify locally first:

```bash
flatpak install -y flathub org.flatpak.Builder
flatpak run org.flatpak.Builder --force-clean --sandbox --user --install \
  builddir flatpak/org.deckwerk.DeckWerk.yml
flatpak run --command=flatpak-builder-lint org.flatpak.Builder manifest \
  flatpak/org.deckwerk.DeckWerk.yml
```

After acceptance, each release opens a pull request here regenerating the
manifest's `url` and `sha256`; copy that two-line diff into a pull request
against `flathub/org.deckwerk.DeckWerk`.

`runtime-version` must name a runtime Flathub still supports. Check with
`flatpak remote-ls flathub --system | grep org.freedesktop.Platform` and bump
it when the current one reaches end of life.

## What ships where

| Platform | Channel | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | `brew install --cask vsitzmann/tap/deckwerk` | `deckwerk-<v>-mac-{arm64,x64}.dmg` |
| Linux | Flathub | `deckwerk-<v>-linux-x64.tar.gz` |
| Linux | direct download | `deckwerk-<v>-linux-x64.AppImage`, `deckwerk_<v>_amd64.deb` |
| Windows | GitHub Release | `deckwerk-<v>-win-x64-setup.exe` |
| Any | build from source | [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) |

The `.deb` is still built and attached to each release, so Debian and Ubuntu
users can `sudo apt install ./deckwerk_<v>_amd64.deb`. There is no apt
repository, so it does not update itself — Flathub is the auto-updating Linux
channel.

The macOS `.zip` files and the `latest*.yml` manifests exist for
`electron-updater`, which is not wired up yet. They are cheap to keep
producing and are what an in-app updater will need.

## Known gaps

- **No Linux arm64.** Adding it means another matrix entry on an arm runner;
  nothing in the configuration assumes x64. Until then, arm64 Linux users
  build from source ([BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md)).
- **No auto-update.** `electron-updater` is not installed. The metadata it
  needs is already being produced.
